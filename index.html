title: WHO-WG - Unofficial home for OWL and RDF specification correction and enhancement
---
<h1>Welcome to the WoLERY</h1>

<p>W3C has created a number of recommendations and other documents
related to OWL and RDF. These documents were created under the auspices of
specifically and narrowly chartered working groups.</p> 

<p>Once a working group has reached the end of it's charter, it is
disbanded.   <a href="http://www.w3.org/2005/10/Process-20051014/tr.html#rec-modify"> Unfortunately, this means that if errors and ommisions
are discovered in a document after the working group has expired, even
if they are purely typographical, there is no way to correct the
recommendations without rechartering a new working group.</a>  Chartering
such a working group can be a difficult and time-consuming <a href="http://www.w3.org/2005/10/Process-20051014/">process</a>.</p>

<p>At this time there are no W3C working groups whose charter covers
the ongoing maintenance of OWL and RDF related documents. This leaves
no ready mechanism in place for addressing important issues such the handling
of RDF 1.1 simple literals in OWL 2.</p>
<p style="text-align:center; font-weight:bold; font-size:110%; font-style:italic;"> Until a working 
group exists, the WHO-WG stands watch to guard the realms of OWLs. 
</p> 

<h2>WHO-WG: Mission Statement</h2>
<ul> 
  <li> Prepare corrected versions of relevant OWL and RDF
  recommendations, incorporating listed errata, and correcting or
  highlighting known ommisions and  ambiguities.
  <li> Collect or prepare  documents for existing OWL extensions, such
  as the <a
  href="http://webont.org/owled/2009/papers/owled2009_submission_16.pdf">
  Manchester and FSS syntaxes for SWRL</a> 
  <li> Produce documents that can readily be taken up by appropriately
  chartered W3 working groups. 
</ul>

<h2>WHO-WG: Principles</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Be Open
  <ul>
    <li> Reject kings, princes, and voting. Believe in rough consensus and running code. 
    <li> Use github to track changes to base spec.
    <li> If possible, use prior WG mailing lists for
  discussion.
    <li>Report changes and errata to existing comments list. 
  </ul>
  <li> Be Courteous
  <ul>
  <li> If possible, ask previous editors of documents being modified to review
  or edit any proposed changes.
  <li> Do not attribute modifications to a document to the previous editors 
  <li> Report errata not listed on current site
  <li> Ensure modified documents are immediately distinguishable from
  official recommendations.
  </ul>
   <li> Obey the Law
 <ul>
  <li>  Do not use W3C logos or trademarks unless authorized.
  <li>  Use document status labels that clearly indicate where documents
   have no official status in the W3C process.
  <li>  Any changes or work performed to WHO-WG must follow the <a
  href="http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Patent-Policy-20040205/">W3
  Patent Policy</a>, where Participation in the Working Group shall
  include but not be limited to the submission of any suggested text via mailing list, issue
   tracker, or github pull request. No exclusion from the licensing
  Requirements under section 4 of the W3 Patent Policy shall be
  possible.  
  <li> Where changes to documents in the repository are applied by an
  editor based on discussions taking place on a mailing list or issue
  tracker, the editor applying the change shall record the provenance
  of the changes in such a way as to facilitate verification of compliance with the
  W3C Patent policy.  
 </ul>

  <li> Respect Everyone
  <ul>
    <li> Where possible, follow the W3 communications team style guide.
    <li> Make documents as accessible as possible.
    <li> If possible, track issues using numbers that do not conflict
  with relevant W3 ISSUE / errata numbering.
    <li> Separate corrections and clarifications (levels 1-3) from new
  features (level 4) 
 </ul>
</ul>
<h1>Initial Issues </h1>
<h2>OWL 2.0.1</h2>
<ul>
  <li> Merge in errata.
  <li> Clarify which axioms allow duplicate terms to be removed (the
  DisjointUnionOf problem)
  <li> Known errors in OWL 2.0 AS/FSS spec, Primer.
  <li> Note problem caused by removal of plain literals from
  RDF. Describe how to rdf:langString can be handled
  transparently. Clarify whether or not xsd:string may be removed when
  serializing to non-rdf datatypes.
</ul>
<h2>RDF 1.1</h2>
<ul>
  <li> Add rdf:langRange facet for rdf:langString?
  <li> Add text  to PlainLiteral spec noting that plain literal
  concept is obsolete.
  <li> Correct langRange example in PlainLiteral
</ul>

<div><h2>Mathjax check</h2>
Checking to see if the site is 
<ul>
<li>fixed
<li>functional
</ul>
$$
Y = \lambda f.(\lambda x. f(x x))(\lambda x.f(x x))
$$
</div>

<div><h2>Identity management</h2>
The following lines should handle identity management:
\begin{align}
\forall x. x = x && \text{reflexivity}\\
\forall x,y,z. (x = y \wedge y = z \rightarrow x = z) && \text{transitivity}\\
\forall x,y.(x = y \rightarrow y = x) && \text{symmetry}\\ 
\forall x,y.(x = y \rightarrow \forall \Phi. (\Phi(x) \leftrightarrow \Phi(y))) && \text{indiscernibility of identicals}\\
\forall x,y.( \forall \Phi. (\Phi(x) \leftrightarrow \Phi(y))  \rightarrow x = y) && \text{identity of indiscernibles}
\end{align}
</div>
<div><h2>Emergency Unicorns</h2>
$$
 (\text{=1}\thinspace\mathsf{hasPart}.\mathsf{Horn}) \sqcap \mathsf{Horse}
$$
</div>
