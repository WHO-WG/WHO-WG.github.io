title: WHO-WG - Unofficial home for OWL and RDF specification correction and enhancement
---
<h1>Welcome to the WoLERY</h1>

<p>W3C has created a number of recommendations and other documents
related to OWL and RDF. These documents were created under the auspices of
specifically and narrowly chartered working groups.</p> 

<p>Once a working group has reached the end of it's charter, it is
disbanded.    Unfortunately, this means that if errors and ommisions
are discovered in a document after the working group has expired, even
if they are purely typographical, there is no way to correct the
recommendations without rechartering a new working group.  Chartering
such a working group can be a difficult and time-consuming <a href="http://www.w3.org/2005/10/Process-20051014/">process</a>.</p>

<p>At this time there are no W3C working groups whose charter covers
the ongoing maintenance of OWL and RDF related documents. This leaves
no ready mechanism in place for addressing important issues such the handling
of RDF 1.1 simple literals in OWL 2.</p>
<p style="text-align:center; font-weight:bold; font-size:110%; font-style:italic;"> Until such a working 
group exists, WHO-WG stands watch to guard the realms of OWLs. 
</p> 

<h2>WHO-WG: Mission Statement</h2>
<ul> 
  <li> Prepare corrected versions of relevant OWL and RDF
  recommendations, incorporating listed errata, and correcting or
  highlighting known ommisions and  ambiguities.
  <li> Collect or prepare  documents for existing OWL extensions, such
  as the <a
  href="http://webont.org/owled/2009/papers/owled2009_submission_16.pdf">
  Manchester and FSS syntaxes for SWRL</a> 
  <li> Produce documents that can readily be taken up by appropriately
  chartered W3 working groups. 
</ul>

<h2>WHO-WG: Principles</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Be Open:
  <ul>
    <li> We reject kings, princes, and voting. We believe in rough consensus and running code. 
    <li> Use github to track changes to base spec.
  </ul>
  <li> If possible, ask editors of documents being modified to review
  or edit any proposed changes.  
  <li> If possible, use prior WG mailing lists for discussion.
  <li> If possible, track issues using numbers that do not conflict
  with relevant WGs ISSUE-XX numbering
  <li> Ensure modified documents are clearly distinguished from
  published recommendations (e.g. do not use W3C logo, use distinct
  document status.
  <li> Where not in conflict with above, follow W3 style guide.
  <li> Separate corrections and clarifications (levels 1-3) from new
  features (level 4) 

</ul>

<h2>OWL 2.0.1</h2>
<ul>
  <li> Merge in errata.
  <li> Clarify which axioms allow duplicate terms to be removed (the
  DisjointUnionOf problem)
  <li> Known errors in OWL 2.0 AS/FSS spec, Primer.
  <li> Note problem caused by removal of plain literals from
  RDF. Describe how to rdf:langString can be handled
  transparently. Clarify whether or not xsd:string may be removed when
  serializing to non-rdf datatypes.
</ul>
<h2>RDF 1.1</h2>
<ul>
  <li> Add rdf:langRange facet for rdf:langString?
  <li> Add text  to PlainLiteral spec noting that plain literal
  concept is obsolete.
  <li> Correct langRange example in PlainLiteral
</ul>

<div><h2>Mathjax check</h2>
Checking to see if the site is 
<ul>
<li>fixed
<li>functional
</ul>
$$
Y = \lambda f.(\lambda x. f(x x))(\lambda x.f(x x))
$$
</div>

<div><h2>Identity management</h2>
The following lines should handle identity management:
\begin{align}
\forall x. x = x && \text{reflexivity}\\
\forall x,y,z. (x = y \wedge y = z \rightarrow x = z) && \text{transitivity}\\
\forall x,y.(x = y \rightarrow y = x) && \text{symmetry}\\ 
\forall x,y.(x = y \rightarrow \forall \Phi. (\Phi(x) \leftrightarrow \Phi(y))) && \text{indiscernibility of identicals}\\
\forall x,y.( \forall \Phi. (\Phi(x) \leftrightarrow \Phi(y))  \rightarrow x = y) && \text{identity of indiscernibles}
\end{align}
</div>
<div><h2>Emergency Unicorns</h2>
$$
 (\text{=1}\thinspace\mathsf{hasPart}.\mathsf{Horn}) \sqcap \mathsf{Horse}
$$
</div>
