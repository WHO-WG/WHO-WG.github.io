title: WHO-WG - Unofficial home for OWL and RDF specification correction and enhancement
---
<h1>Welcome to the WoLERY</h1>
<ul>
  <li> W3C has produced specs.
  <li> OWL and RDF working groups have disolved
  <li> Can't fix errors in Recommendations with chartering a WG.
</ul>
<p>W3C has produced  a number of documents that provide specifications
and other information relating to OWL and RDF, under the auspices of
carefully chartered working groups.</p> 

<p>Unfortunately, once a working group has finished the tasks  </p>
<h2>WHO-WG: Mission Statement</h2>
<ul>
  <li> Prepare corrected versions of relevant OWL and RDF
  recommendations, incorporating known errata.
  <li> Rough consensus and running code. 
  <li> Use version control (i.e. GIT) to track changes to base spec.
  <li> If possible, former WG mailing lists for discussion.
</ul>

<h2>OWL 2.0.1</h2>
<ul>
  <li> Merge in errata.
  <li> Clarify which axioms allow duplicate terms to be removed (the
  DisjointUnionOf problem)
  <li> Known errors in OWL 2.0 AS/FSS spec, Primer.
  <li> Note problem caused by removal of plain literals from
  RDF. Describe how to rdf:langString can be handled
  transparently. Clarify whether or not xsd:string may be removed when
  serializing to non-rdf datatypes.
</ul>
<h2>RDF 1.1</h2>
<ul>
  <li> Add rdf:langRange facet for rdf:langString
  <li> Add language  to PlainLiteral spec noting that plain literal
  concept is obsolete.  
</ul>

<div><h2>Mathjax check</h2>
Checking to see if the site is 
<ul>
<li>fixed
<li>functional
</ul>
$$
Y = \lambda f.(\lambda x. f(x x))(\lambda x.f(x x))
$$
</div>

<div><h2>Identity management</h2>
The following lines should handle identity management:
\begin{align}
\forall x. x = x && \text{reflexivity}\\
\forall x,y,z. (x = y \wedge y = z \rightarrow x = z) && \text{transitivity}\\
\forall x,y.(x = y \rightarrow y = x) && \text{symmetry}\\ 
\forall x,y.(x = y \rightarrow \forall \Phi. (\Phi(x) \leftrightarrow \Phi(y))) && \text{indiscernibility of identicals}\\
\forall x,y.( \forall \Phi. (\Phi(x) \leftrightarrow \Phi(y))  \rightarrow x = y) && \text{identity of indiscernibles}
\end{align}
</div>
<div><h2>Emergency Unicorns</h2>
$$
 (\text{=1}\thinspace\mathsf{hasPart}.\mathsf{Horn}) \sqcap \mathsf{Horse}
$$
